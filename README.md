# MLang: The Mathematics Language

## What is M
#### M is an open-source language that is meant to help people learn about Tokenizers, Parsers, and interpreters. It supports variables, logging, and expressions.

## Project Status:
- Waiting...

## Known Bugs
- Things like `let a = 5; -a` is read as `let a = 5-a` which causes an error due to 'a' being undefined. (Progress: On Hold)

## To-Do
- [ ] Arrays (Priority: HIGH)
- [ ] Javascript API (Priority: extremely low / not expected soon)

## Done
- [x] Pseudo-pointers / Reference to `$pid` (passed in variable to a function) and `$last` (last variable set) (Priority: unexpected)
- [x] Conditional statements (Priority: HIGH)
- [x] Multi-line comments (Priority: extremely low)
- [x] Import files (Priority: unknown)
- [x] Minimal string support (Priority: unknown)
- [x] Functions (Priority: Medium)
- [x] Unit Conversion (Priority: unknown)
- [x] Expressions (Priority: HIGH)
- [x] Variables (Priority: Medium)
- [x] Logging (Priority: Low)
- [x] Built-in Functions (Priority: unknown)


## Want a tutorial on how you can make your own language?
### Well, are you in luck! I've recently created a tutorial for making [a simple number interpreter from scratch](https://number-interpreter-from-scratch.battledash2.repl.co).
